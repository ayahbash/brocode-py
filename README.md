## 01. print function 
```python
print("hello world")
```
## 02. variables
- a **variable** is a container for a value, it behaves as the value that it contains.
### ‚ô•Ô∏è strings
```python
name = "Bro"
print(type(name))
print("Hello " + name)
```

```python
first_name="Bro"
last_name="Code"
full_name=first_name + last_name
print("Hello "+ full_name)
``````
### ‚ô•Ô∏è integers
```python
age = 21
# to increment
age +=1 
print(age)
print('Your age is: '+str(age))
```
> when assigning value for integer type variables we do **not** use quotes as strings are not used in math.
### ‚ô•Ô∏è float
```python
height=250.5
print(height)
```
### ‚ô•Ô∏è boolean
> can only store **True** or **False** values
```python
human = False
print(human)
```
- use the '**type**' function to find variable data type

```python
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(height))
print(type(human))
```
## 03.multiple assignment
- **multiple assignment** allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time in one line of code.
```python
name, age, attractive= "Bro", 32, True
print(name, age, attractive)
```
> in case different variables hold same value
```python
Bill = Tina = Steve = 30
print(Bill)
```
## 04. string methods 
- some functions we can use with strings
```python
print(name.find("B"))
print(name.capitalize())
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
print(name.isdigit())
print(name.isalpha())
print(name.count("o")) 
print(name.replace("o", 'a'))
print(name*3)
```
## 05. type cast
- **type casting** is converting the data type of a value to another data type.
```python
x = 1     #int
y = 2.0   #float
z = "3"   #str

# convert to string
x = str(x) 
y = str(y)
z = str(z)
# convert to float
x = float(x)
y = float(y)
z = float(z)
# convert to integer
x = int(x)
y = int(y)
z = int(z)
```
## 06. user input
```python
name = input("What is your name?: ")
age = int(input("How old are you?: "))
height = float(input("How tall are you?: "))

print("Hello "+name)
print("You are "+str(age)+ " years old")
print("You are "+str(height)+ " cm tall")
```
> we've converted the age into integer data type when entering it but we had to convert it back to string to display it

## 07. math functions
```python
import math

pi = 3.14
x = 1
y = 2
z = 3

print(round(pi))
print(math.ceil(pi))
print(math.floor(pi))
print(abs(pi)) # absolute value
print(pow(pi, 2)) # power function
print(math.sqrt(pi)) # square root
print(max(pi,x,y,z)) # finds max value
print(min(pi,x,y,z)) # finds min value
```
## 08. string slicing
- **string slicing** is creating a *substring* by extracting elements from another string. **indexing[ ]** or **slice( )**
```python
# [start:stop:step]
# start index in inclusive. stop index is exclusive.
# step is how much the index increases. default is 1.
name = "Bro Code"
first_name = name[:3]
last_name = name[4:]
funky_name = name[::3]
reversed_name = name[::-1]
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
print(funky_name)

website1 = 'http://test.com'
website2 = 'http://google.com'
slice = slice(7,-4)
print(website1[slice])
print(website2[slice])
```
## 09. if statements
- a block of code that will execute if its condition is **true**.
```python
age = int(input("How old are you?:"))

if age == 100:
    print("You are a century old!")
elif age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
elif age <0:
    print("You have not been born yet!")
else:
    print("You are a child!")
```
## 10. logical operators
- the logical operators ( **AND** , **OR** , **NOT** ) are used to check if two or more conditional statements are true.
```python
temp = int(input("What is the temperature ourside?: "))

if (temp >= 0 and temp <= 30):
    print("The weather is good today!")
    print("Go outside!")
elif (temp <0 or temp >30):
    print("The weather is bad today!")
    print("Stay inside!")

# the NOT operator inverts the statement
if not(temp >= 0 and temp <= 30):
    print("The weather is bad today!")
    print("Stay inside!")
elif not(temp <0 or temp >30):
    print("The weather is good today!")
    print("Go outside!")
```
## 11. while loops

- a **while** loop is a statement that will execute its block of code as long as its condition is true

```python
name = ""
while len(name) == 0: # we can also write "while not name:"
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello "+name)
```
## 12. for loops
- a **for** loop is a statement that will execute its block of code a limited amount of times
``` python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
- **countdown timer**
```python
import time

for seconds in range(10,0,-1):
    print(seconds)
    time.sleep(1)
print("Happy New Year!")
```

## 13. nested loops
```python
rows = int(input("How many rows?: "))
columns = int(input("How many columns?: "))
symbol = input("Enter a symbol to use: ")

for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(columns):
        print(symbol, end="") # to avoid making a new line
    print()
```

## 14. loop control statements
- used to *change* a loop's execution from its normal sequence
```python
# break = used to terminate the loop entirely
# continue = skips to the next iteration of the loop
# pass = does nothing, acts as a placeholder

while True:
    name = input("Enter your name: ")
    if name !="":
        break

phone_number = "123-456-7890"
for i in phone_number:
    if i == "-":
        continue
    print(i, end="")

for i in range(1,21):
    if i == 13:
        pass
    else: print(i)
```

## 15. lists
- **lists** are used to store multiple items in a single variable
```python
food = ["pizza", "hamburger", "hotdog"]

food.append("ice cream")
food.remove("hotdog")
food.pop() #removes last element in list
food.insert(0,"cake")
food.sort()
food.clear()

print(food[0])

for x in food:
    print(x)
```

## 16. 2D lists
- a **2D list** is basically a list of lists

```python
drinks = ["coffee", "soda", "tea"]
dinner = ["pizza", "hamburger", "hotdog"]
desert = ["cake", "ice cream"]

food = [drinks, dinner, desert]
print(food[0][1])
print(food[1][1])
```

## 17. tuples
- a **tuple** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable, it's used to group together related data
```python
student = ("Bro", 21, "male")
print(student.count("Bro")) 
print(student.index("male"))

for x in student:
    print(x)

if "Bro" in student:
    print("Bro is here!")
```

## 18. sets
- a **set** is a collection which is unordered, unindexed and doesn't include duplicare values

```python
utensils = {"fork", "spoon", "knife"}
dishes = {"bowl", "plate", "cup", "knife"}

utensils.add("napkin")
utensils.remove("fork")
utensils.clear()
dishes.update(utensils)
dinner_table = utensils.union(dishes)

print(dishes.difference(utensils))
print(utensils.intersection(dishes))

for x in dinner_table:
    print(x)
```
## 19. dictionaries
- a **dictionary** is a changeable, unordered collection of unique *key:value* pairs. dictionaries are fast because they use hashing, which allows us to access a value quickly!

```python
capitals = {'USA':'Washington DC',
            'India':'New Dehli',
            'China': 'Beijing',
            'Russia': 'Moscow'}
print(capitals['Russia']) #this causes issues if not in dictionary. Get method better.
print(capitals.get('Germany')) # this will return None if not there.
print(capitals.keys()) # will print only the keys
print(capitals.values()) # will print only the values
print(capitals.items()) # will print all items

for key, value in capitals.items(): # this will also print whole dictionary.
    print(key, value)

capitals.update({'Germany': 'Berlin'}) # way to add to dictionary.
capitals.update({'USA': 'Las Vegas'}) # way to update or add to dictionary.
capitals.pop('China') # removes key, value from dictionary.
capitals.clear()
```

## 20. indexing
- the **index operator** ```[]``` gives us access to a sequence's element (ex. strings, lists, tuples..)

```python
name = "bro Code!"
if(name[0].islower()):
    name = name.capitalize()
print(name)

first_name = name[:3].upper()
last_name = name[4:].lower()
last_character = name[-1]

print(first_name)
print(last_name)
print(last_character)
```

## 21. functions!
- a **function** is a block of code that is executed only when it is called

```python
def hello(first_name, last_name, age): # parameters
    print("Hello "+first_name+" "+last_name)
    print("You are "+ str(age) + " years old") # we need to convert it to string
    print("Have a nice day!")

hello("Bro", "Code", 21) # arguments
```
## 22. return statement
- the **return** value is the value or object that a function sends back to the caller

```python
def multiply(number1, number2):
    return number1 * number2 # the result

x = multiply(6,8)
print(x)
```
## 23. keyword arguments
- arguments preceded by an identifier when passed to a function are known as **keyword arguments**; unlike positional arguments, their order does *not* matter, as python knows the names of the arguments that the function receives

```python
def hello(first,middle,last):
    print("Hello "+first+" "+middle+" "+last)

hello("Code", "Dude", "Bro") # positional arguments.
hello(last="Code", middle="Dude", first="Bro") # keyword arguments.
```
## 24. nested function calls
- **nested function calls** are when one function call is used as an argument for another function. these calls are resolved from the innermost to the outermost, with the return value of the inner function serving as the argument for the next outer function

```python
num = input("Enter a whole positive number: ")
print(num)
num = float(num)
print(num)
num = abs(num)
print(num)
num = round(num)
print(num)
# we can simplify all this using a nested function call
print(round(abs(float(input("Enter a whole positive number: ")))))
```
## 25. variable scope
- the region where a variable is recognized is called its **scope**. a variable is only available within the scope where it is created, and both global and local versions of a variable can be created

```python
name = "Bro" # global scope (available inside & outside functions)

def display_name():
    name = "Code" # local scope (available only inside this function)
    print(name)

# LEGB Rule: Local -> Enclosing -> Global -> Built-in
display_name()
print(name)
``````

## 26. *args
- ***args** is a parameter that will pack all arguments into a tuple, it is useful so that a function can accept a varying amount of arguments

```python
def add(*stuff):
    sum = 0
    # stuff = list(stuff) # if you want to change an item in tuple, turn into list
    #stuff[0] = 0    # this turns the 1st item to 0.
    
    for i in stuff:
        sum += i
    return sum

print(add(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8))
```
## 27. **kwargs
- ****kwargs** is a parameter that will pack all arguments into a dictionary, it is useful so that a function can accept a varying amount of *keyword* arguments

```python
def hello(**kwargs):  # just need the two **, can name it anything
    print("Hello "+ kwargs['first']+" "+kwargs['last'])
    print("Hello",end=" ")
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(value, end= " ")  # end=" " replaces the new line character (default) with space.

hello(title="Mr.", first="Bro", middle="Dude", last="Code")
```
## 28. string format
- the **```str.format()```** is an optional method that gives users more control when displaying outputs

```python
animal = "cow"
item = "moon"

# print("The "+animal+" jumped over the "+item)
# a better way to write this would be using the str.format()

print("The {} jumped over the {}".format(animal, item))
print("The {0} jumped over the {1}".format(animal, item)) # positional argument
print("The {food} jumped over the {house}".format(house="tall", food="pizza"))  # keyword argument

# another way to format
text = "The {} jumped over the {}"
print(text.format(animal, item))

name = "Bro"
print("Hello, my name is {:10}".format(name))  # adding ten spacing worth of padding after name

number = 3.14
print("The number pi is {:.3f}".format(number))  #adds 3 deciminal places.
print("The number is {:,}".format(number)) # adds commas
print("The number is {:b}".format(number)) # displays it in binary
print("The number is {:o}".format(number)) # displays it in octodecimal
print("The number is {:X}".format(number)) # displays it in hexidicimal.
print("The number is {:E}".format(number))
```
## 29. random numbers
```python
import random
x = random.randint(1,6) # random integer  between 1 and 6
y = random.random()     # random floating point number

my_list = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
z = random.choice(my_list)

cards = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,'J','Q','K','A']
random.shuffle(cards)
print(cards)
```

## 30. exception handling
- **exceptions** are events detected during execution that interrupt the flow of a program

```python
try:
    numerator = int(input("Enter a number to divide: "))
    denominator = int(input("Enter a number to divide by: "))
    results = numerator / denominator
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero! Idiot!")
except ValueError:
    print("Enter only numbers please.")
except Exception:  
# good pratice to put specific exceptions first.
    print("Something went wrong :(")
else:
    print(results)
finally:  # should be at end as you want to close files when done
    print("This will always execute")
```
## 31. file detection
```python
import os
path = "C:\\Users\\Cakow\\Desktop\\test.txt"
# need to manually put in double back slashes
if os.path.exists(path):
    print("That location exists!")
    if os.path.isfile(path):
        print("That is a file")
    elif os.path.isdir(path):
        print("That is a directory")
else:
    print("That location does not exist")
```

## 32. reading a file
 ```python
 try:
    with open('test.txt') as file:  # will need file path and double-slashes if the file isn't here
        print(file.read())  #'with' will also close files after reading them!
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("That file was not found")
```
## 33. writing a file
```python
text = "Hello \nThis is some text \nHave a good date!\n"# \n is a new line.
with open('test.txt', 'w') as file: # by default the mode is r. but here it is set to w for write
    # mode 'a' will append the new lines to the file
  file.write(text)
```

## 34. copying a file
```python
# copyfile() = copies contents of a file
# copy()     = copyfile(0 + persmission mode + destination can be a directory
# copy2()    = copy() + copies metadata (file's creation and modification times)

import shutil  # good module to copy files
shutil.copyfile('test.txt', 'copy.txt') # this function has both a source and a destination
# if the file is not here, you would need to list the file path
```
## 35. moving a file 
```python
import os
source = "test.txt"
destination = "C:\\Users\\Cakow\\Desktop\\test.txt"

try: # recommended doing code in try/except block to handle issues!
    if os.path.exists(destination):
        print("There is already a file there")
    else:
        os.replace(source,destination)
        print(source+" was moved")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(source+" was not found")
```
## 36. deleting a file
```python
import os
import shutil
path = 'test.txt'

try:
    os.remove(path)     # delete a file
  # os.rmdir(path)      # delete a file or empty folder
  # shutil.rmtree(path) # delete directory and all files contained within
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("That file was not found")
except PermissionError:
    print("You do not have permission to delete that")
except OSError:
    print("That folder contains files")
else:
    print(path+" was deleted")
```

## 37. modules!
- a **module** is a file containing python code; it can contain functions, classes.. modules are used with *modular programming*, which is used to separate a program into parts

> in **messages.py**
```python
def hello():
  print("Hello! Have a nice day!")

def bye():
  print("Bye! Have a wonderful time")
```
> in our **main** module
```python
import messages # can import messages (hello,bye) OR messages * (all of it)

messages.hello()
messages.bye()
```
